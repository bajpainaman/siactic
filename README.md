Sciatic Protocol is an open protocol that enables machine learning entities across any platform to discover, communicate, and engage in transactions seamlessly. The Sciatic Protocol facilitates the co-creation of advanced AI solutions by combining services from various machine learning providers.

Sciatic Protocol is a collection of open specifications consisting of protocol APIs, message formats, network design, and reference architectures. It allows any two or more entities to execute machine learning transactions, discover resources, and intercommunicate without being on the same platform.

This server-to-server communication protocol enables any consumer-facing online platform to discover and interact with any machine learning service with minimal implementation overhead. The server-to-server nature of the protocol allows rich AI experiences to be built by integrating services from multiple independent platforms.

Sciatic Protocol decouples the demand-side digital infrastructure (such as applications and other channels) from the supply-side service provisioning infrastructure. It achieves this by making integrated machine learning services available on any online consumer interface, such as online maps, messaging apps, wallets, voice assistant apps, and devices that have mainstream adoption.

Sciatic is a protocol, not a platform. It adopts a decentralized architecture that eliminates the need for creating a centralized platform to integrate services from multiple providers. It ensures privacy and security by design, enabling secure, encrypted interactions between entities.

## Core Specification

Sciatic Protocol - Core Specification defines a generic, abstracted API that, when implemented, allows domain-agnostic interoperable machine learning transactions between entities, regardless of the platforms they are on. An analogy similar to this would be the case of the SMTP specification that allows email communication between any two platforms that have implemented the same specification.

The core specification defines APIs for the following events in machine learning:

### Discovery
This involves activities like platform discovery, model browsing, filtering, and dataset viewing.

### Transaction
This involves activities like initiating model training, performing inference, parameter tuning, and ultimately confirming the transaction.

### Execution
This involves all post-transaction activities like tracking progress, updating models, canceling tasks, and status updates.

### Post-Execution
This involves all post-execution activities like rating models, providing feedback, support, and managing model updates and replacements.

## Inter-Model Communication

To enable seamless inter-communication between different machine learning models, Sciatic Protocol provides the following features:

### Standard Interfaces
Sciatic Protocol defines standard interfaces for different types of models (e.g., classifiers, regressors, neural networks). These interfaces ensure that models can interact with each other regardless of their underlying implementations.

### Compatibility Guidelines
Sciatic Protocol includes guidelines for ensuring compatibility between models. These guidelines cover:
- **Input/Output Formats**: Standardizing the formats of inputs and outputs to ensure interoperability.
- **Parameter Exchange**: Defining how models can exchange parameters and hyperparameters.
- **Versioning**: Implementing version control to manage updates and changes to models.

- **Execution:** Post-training, the model is evaluated on Platform B for performance metrics and compared with existing benchmarks.
- **Post-Execution:** Feedback and updates are exchanged between the platforms to improve model accuracy and efficiency over time.

#### 2. **Ensemble Learning and Model Fusion**

**Scenario:** A fintech company aims to improve fraud detection by combining outputs from multiple anomaly detection models.

- **Discovery:** Sciatic Protocol enables the company to discover and evaluate various anomaly detection models available across different AI service providers.
- **Transaction:** They implement an ensemble learning approach where outputs from different models are fused together to achieve higher detection accuracy.
- **Execution:** During real-time operations, outputs from individual models are combined using specified fusion algorithms to generate a unified fraud risk score.
- **Post-Execution:** The combined model's performance is continuously monitored and adjusted based on feedback loops from fraud analysts and system performance metrics.

#### 3. **Transfer Learning and Model Adaptation**

**Scenario:** A healthcare provider wants to deploy a pre-trained medical image classification model across multiple hospital networks.

- **Discovery:** Sciatic Protocol helps identify suitable pre-trained models and datasets for medical imaging tasks from various AI vendors.
- **Transaction:** They leverage transfer learning techniques to fine-tune the pre-trained model on specific hospital datasets while maintaining interoperability.
- **Execution:** The adapted model is deployed across different hospital networks, where it performs image classification tasks tailored to local patient demographics and medical conditions.
- **Post-Execution:** Continuous updates and refinements are made to the model based on new medical data and evolving healthcare practices across the network.

#### 4. **Model Collaboration and Federated Learning**

**Scenario:** A consortium of financial institutions collaborates to improve credit scoring models while maintaining data privacy.

- **Discovery:** Sciatic Protocol facilitates the discovery of compatible credit scoring models and secure data sharing mechanisms between member institutions.
- **Transaction:** Federated learning techniques are employed where individual institutions train local models on their proprietary data while aggregating model updates centrally.
- **Execution:** Model updates are securely exchanged among institutions, allowing for collaborative model training without sharing sensitive customer information.
- **Post-Execution:** Federated learning results in improved credit scoring accuracy across the consortium while adhering to regulatory data privacy requirements.

#### 5. **Multi-Modal Integration and AI Fusion**

**Scenario:** A smart city initiative integrates data from various sensors and IoT devices to optimize urban planning decisions.

- **Discovery:** Sciatic Protocol enables the integration of machine learning models for traffic prediction, air quality monitoring, and energy consumption forecasting from multiple IoT service providers.
- **Transaction:** AI fusion techniques combine outputs from different modalities (e.g., traffic flow data, weather forecasts) to provide real-time insights for city planners.
- **Execution:** Integrated models generate recommendations for optimizing traffic flow, reducing pollution, and enhancing energy efficiency across different urban sectors.
- **Post-Execution:** Continuous model refinement based on real-time data feeds and feedback from city stakeholders ensures adaptive and responsive urban management strategies.
