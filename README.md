# Sciatic Protocol

Sciatic Protocol is an open protocol that enables machine learning entities across any platform to discover, communicate, and engage in transactions seamlessly. The Sciatic Protocol facilitates the co-creation of advanced AI solutions by combining services from various machine learning providers.

Sciatic Protocol is a collection of open specifications consisting of protocol APIs, message formats, network design, and reference architectures. It allows any two or more entities to execute machine learning transactions, discover resources, and intercommunicate without being on the same platform.

This server-to-server communication protocol enables any consumer-facing online platform to discover and interact with any machine learning service with minimal implementation overhead. The server-to-server nature of the protocol allows rich AI experiences to be built by integrating services from multiple independent platforms.

Sciatic Protocol decouples the demand-side digital infrastructure (such as applications and other channels) from the supply-side service provisioning infrastructure. It achieves this by making integrated machine learning services available on any online consumer interface, such as online maps, messaging apps, wallets, voice assistant apps, and devices that have mainstream adoption.

Sciatic is a protocol, not a platform. It adopts a decentralized architecture that eliminates the need for creating a centralized platform to integrate services from multiple providers. It ensures privacy and security by design, enabling secure, encrypted interactions between entities.

## Core Specification

Sciatic Protocol - Core Specification defines a generic, abstracted API that, when implemented, allows domain-agnostic interoperable machine learning transactions between entities, regardless of the platforms they are on. An analogy similar to this would be the case of the SMTP specification that allows email communication between any two platforms that have implemented the same specification.

The core specification defines APIs for the following events in machine learning:

### Discovery
This involves activities like platform discovery, model browsing, filtering, and dataset viewing.

### Transaction
This involves activities like initiating model training, performing inference, parameter tuning, and ultimately confirming the transaction.

### Execution
This involves all post-transaction activities like tracking progress, updating models, canceling tasks, and status updates.

### Post-Execution
This involves all post-execution activities like rating models, providing feedback, support, and managing model updates and replacements.
