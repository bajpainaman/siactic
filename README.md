## Summary (TL;DR)

**Sciatic Protocol** is an open protocol for decentralized machine learning, enabling universal discovery and interaction of services from any Sciatic-enabled platform. The protocol comprises multiple layers, similar to HTTP, and includes:

- **Application Layer**
- **Network and Transaction Layer**
- **Infrastructure and Security Layer**
- **Certification Layer**
- **Specification and Support Layer**

The decentralized architecture and multi-layered structure ensure secure, privacy-protected interactions and seamless integration of machine learning services across various consumer interfaces.

**Sciatic Protocol** is an open, decentralized protocol designed to enable seamless discovery, communication, and transactions between machine learning entities across any platform. By integrating services from various machine learning providers, Sciatic Protocol facilitates the co-creation of advanced AI solutions.

## Overview

Sciatic Protocol comprises open specifications, including protocol APIs, message formats, network designs, and reference architectures. These components allow multiple entities to execute machine learning transactions, discover resources, and intercommunicate without requiring a shared platform.

This server-to-server communication protocol empowers any consumer-facing online platform to interact with machine learning services with minimal implementation overhead. By decoupling demand-side digital infrastructure (applications and channels) from supply-side service provisioning infrastructure, Sciatic Protocol makes integrated machine learning services accessible on any mainstream consumer interface, such as online maps, messaging apps, wallets, and voice assistant apps.

Sciatic Protocol is not a platform but a protocol that adopts a decentralized architecture, eliminating the need for a centralized platform to integrate services from multiple providers. It ensures privacy and security by design, enabling secure, encrypted interactions between entities.

## Core Specification

The **Sciatic Protocol - Core Specification** defines a generic, abstracted API enabling domain-agnostic, interoperable machine learning transactions between entities across different platforms. It functions similarly to the SMTP specification, which facilitates email communication between any two platforms implementing the same specification.

The core specification includes APIs for the following machine learning events:

### Discovery
- Platform discovery
- Model browsing
- Filtering
- Dataset viewing

### Transaction
- Initiating model training
- Performing inference
- Parameter tuning
- Confirming transactions

### Execution
- Tracking progress
- Updating models
- Canceling tasks
- Status updates

### Post-Execution
- Rating models
- Providing feedback
- Support
- Managing model updates and replacements

## Inter-Model Communication

To enable seamless communication between different machine learning models, Sciatic Protocol provides a robust framework that includes standard interfaces, communication protocols, and integration mechanisms. These features ensure that models can interact efficiently, regardless of their underlying architectures or implementations.

### Standard Interfaces

Sciatic Protocol defines standard interfaces for various types of models, including classifiers, regressors, neural networks, and more. These interfaces provide a consistent way for models to communicate, ensuring interoperability across different platforms and implementations.

- **Model Input/Output Formats:** Standardized formats for model inputs and outputs allow for consistent data exchange between models. This includes predefined structures for data types, feature vectors, and output labels.
- **API Specifications:** Detailed API specifications define how models should expose their functionalities, such as training, inference, and parameter tuning. This standardization ensures that any model adhering to the protocol can be integrated into the ecosystem seamlessly.

### Communication Protocols

Sciatic Protocol includes communication protocols that facilitate efficient and reliable data exchange between models.

- **Request-Response Pattern:** This pattern is used for synchronous communication, where a model sends a request to another model and waits for a response. It is suitable for real-time inference and interactive tasks.
- **Publish-Subscribe Pattern:** For asynchronous communication, models can publish messages to specific topics, and other models can subscribe to those topics to receive updates. This is useful for scenarios like continuous learning and monitoring.
- **Message Queueing:** To handle high-throughput and bursty traffic, message queues are used to buffer and manage the flow of messages between models. This ensures that no data is lost and that models can process messages at their own pace.

### Integration Mechanisms

Sciatic Protocol provides mechanisms for integrating models into complex workflows and pipelines.

- **Workflow Orchestration:** Models can be orchestrated into workflows where the output of one model serves as the input for another. This allows for the creation of complex AI solutions that leverage multiple models in sequence or parallel.
- **Data Pipeline Integration:** The protocol supports integration with data pipelines, enabling models to consume data from various sources and feed processed data back into the pipeline for further analysis or action.
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Models can trigger and respond to events, enabling dynamic and context-aware interactions. For instance, an anomaly detection model can trigger a notification event when it detects unusual patterns, which can then be processed by a response model.




### Standard Interfaces
Standard interfaces for various model types (e.g., classifiers, regressors, neural networks) ensure interaction regardless of underlying implementations.

## Packet Structure

All communications using Sciatic Protocol follow this packet structure:

|  Field        |    Description                                                                                |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  `context`    |    Contains header information for packet switching, key lookup, and encryption               |
|  `message`    |    Contains transaction information visible only to the transaction participants              |

## Transport Protocol

Although Sciatic Protocol is transport agnostic, HTTP is the default transport protocol. Additional security layers, like HTTPS and SSL, are recommended to secure communications.
