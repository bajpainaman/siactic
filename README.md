## Summary (TL;DR)

**Sciatic Protocol** is an open protocol for decentralized machine learning, enabling universal discovery and interaction of services from any Sciatic-enabled platform. The protocol comprises multiple layers, similar to HTTP, and includes:

- **Application Layer**
- **Network and Transaction Layer**
- **Infrastructure and Security Layer**
- **Certification Layer**
- **Specification and Support Layer**

The decentralized architecture and multi-layered structure ensure secure, privacy-protected interactions and seamless integration of machine learning services across various consumer interfaces.

**Sciatic Protocol** is an open, decentralized protocol designed to enable seamless discovery, communication, and transactions between machine learning entities across any platform. By integrating services from various machine learning providers, Sciatic Protocol facilitates the co-creation of advanced AI solutions.

## Overview

Sciatic Protocol comprises open specifications, including protocol APIs, message formats, network designs, and reference architectures. These components allow multiple entities to execute machine learning transactions, discover resources, and intercommunicate without requiring a shared platform.

This server-to-server communication protocol empowers any consumer-facing online platform to interact with machine learning services with minimal implementation overhead. By decoupling demand-side digital infrastructure (applications and channels) from supply-side service provisioning infrastructure, Sciatic Protocol makes integrated machine learning services accessible on any mainstream consumer interface, such as online maps, messaging apps, wallets, and voice assistant apps.

Sciatic Protocol is not a platform but a protocol that adopts a decentralized architecture, eliminating the need for a centralized platform to integrate services from multiple providers. It ensures privacy and security by design, enabling secure, encrypted interactions between entities.

## Core Specification

The **Sciatic Protocol - Core Specification** defines a generic, abstracted API enabling domain-agnostic, interoperable machine learning transactions between entities across different platforms. It functions similarly to the SMTP specification, which facilitates email communication between any two platforms implementing the same specification.

The core specification includes APIs for the following machine learning events:

### Discovery
- Platform discovery
- Model browsing
- Filtering
- Dataset viewing

### Transaction
- Initiating model training
- Performing inference
- Parameter tuning
- Confirming transactions

### Execution
- Tracking progress
- Updating models
- Canceling tasks
- Status updates

### Post-Execution
- Rating models
- Providing feedback
- Support
- Managing model updates and replacements

## Inter-Model Communication

To enable seamless communication between different machine learning models, Sciatic Protocol provides:

### Standard Interfaces
Standard interfaces for various model types (e.g., classifiers, regressors, neural networks) ensure interaction regardless of underlying implementations.

## Packet Structure

All communications using Sciatic Protocol follow this packet structure:

|  Field        |    Description                                                                                |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  `context`    |    Contains header information for packet switching, key lookup, and encryption               |
|  `message`    |    Contains transaction information visible only to the transaction participants              |

## Transport Protocol

Although Sciatic Protocol is transport agnostic, HTTP is the default transport protocol. Additional security layers, like HTTPS and SSL, are recommended to secure communications.
