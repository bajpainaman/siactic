# 🌟 Sciatic Protocol 🌟

Welcome to the Sciatic Protocol, where the magic of machine learning meets seamless connectivity! 🚀

Sciatic Protocol is your open ticket to a world where machine learning entities can effortlessly discover, communicate, and engage in transactions across any platform. Think of it as the ultimate co-working space for AI services, where ideas and solutions blend to create groundbreaking innovations!

## 🎉 What is Sciatic Protocol? 🎉

Sciatic Protocol is a set of open specifications that include protocol APIs, message formats, network design, and reference architectures. It’s designed to allow machine learning entities to execute transactions, discover resources, and intercommunicate, all without needing to be on the same platform. Imagine a bustling marketplace where AI services meet and mingle!

This server-to-server communication protocol allows consumer-facing platforms to discover and interact with machine learning services with minimal fuss. By connecting multiple independent platforms, it creates rich AI experiences that feel like magic!

## 🧩 How Does It Work? 🧩

The Sciatic Protocol decouples the demand-side (like apps and online channels) from the supply-side (service provisioning infrastructure). It makes integrated machine learning services available on any consumer interface you can think of—online maps, messaging apps, wallets, voice assistants, you name it!

It's not a platform; it's a protocol! With its decentralized architecture, there's no need for a centralized hub. Plus, it’s built with privacy and security at its core, ensuring secure, encrypted interactions between entities. Your data, your rules!

## 📚 Core Specification 📚

The Sciatic Protocol - Core Specification defines a generic API that allows domain-agnostic, interoperable machine learning transactions. Think of it like the SMTP for email—if everyone speaks the same language, they can all chat away happily!

Here's what it covers:

### 🔍 Discovery
- Platform discovery
- Model browsing
- Filtering
- Dataset viewing

### 💼 Transaction
- Initiating model training
- Performing inference
- Parameter tuning
- Confirming transactions

### 🛠 Execution
- Tracking progress
- Updating models
- Canceling tasks
- Status updates

### 🌟 Post-Execution
- Rating models
- Providing feedback
- Support
- Managing updates and replacements
